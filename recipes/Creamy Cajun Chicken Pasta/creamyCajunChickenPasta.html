        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Cajun Seasoning</strong></p>
            <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <p><strong>Chicken Pasta</strong></p>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 lb penne pasta, uncooked</li>
            <li>15 oz fire roasted diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 oz cream cheese</li>
            <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is very hot and the butter is melted and foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.</li>
            <li>Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to saut√© for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes (with the juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.</li>
            <li>Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into the sauce. Top the pasta with sliced green onions and serve.</li>
        </ol>
